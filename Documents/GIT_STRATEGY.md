## Git strategy

- we only use main and feature branches development for now
- We follow [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow#:~:text=Gitflow%20Workflow%20is%20a%20Git,designed%20around%20the%20project%20release.) name convention for branch name
- Commit message: start with issue No. e.g `issue-1 setup project`
- For PR name and content, follow the PR template
- For issue name and content, follow the issue template
